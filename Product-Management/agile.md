We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working Software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Responding to change over Following a Plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

9. Enhance agility through attention to technical detail and design
10. Keep things simple by developing just enough to get the job done for right now
