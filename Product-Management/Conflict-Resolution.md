### Problems, disagreements, and conflicts

- A **problem** is different from a disagreement as it can be resolved.
- A **disagreement** is a form of creativity! Not negative in themselves.
- A **conflict** is a disagreement with visible tension that persists over time and worsens. 

There are three stages in the development of a conflict: **tension**, **crisis**, and **stagnation**.

- Tension allows for a win-win resolution. It might not be visible to all parties involved.
- Crisis resolution will be win-lose, as some sort of mediation is needed.
- Stagnation is lose-lose. Conflict is visible and might not be solved

### Causes of tension

**Objective causes**

- Technical (disagreement on tasks, process).
- Economic (lack of or insufficient means/resources).
- Power dynamics (competition, power games, will power of the strong, over-reaction of the weak).
- Rules (non-compliance or different interpretation of regulations, rules, contracts).
- Information (incomplete/false, not shared, unspoken, secrets).
- Witnesses and public opinion (acceleration or inhibition of conflict).
- Defective communication (impossibility of dialogue, negative communication, manipulation).

**Subjective causes**
- People and relationships (confrontation of identities, personalities, incivility, relationship to authority).
- Expression of emotions (fear, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, shame, jealousy, suffering).
- Beliefs, values, cultural practices.
- Internal conflict (individual dilemma, personal malaise turned outwards which affects others around the individual).
- Old conflict (simmering resentment).
- Misinterpretation of a situation (over-sensitivity to words, actions, bad faith).
- Confrontation between groups (individual and group loyalties).

Emotions are body's primary esponses to satisfaction or non-satisfactions. Feelings are more abstract and last longer.

1. Listen to your emotions and recognize them
- Denial
- Transformation
- Rationalization
- Displacing the emotion


2. Manage your emotions
- Trigger (avoid repeated triggers, may lead to over-sensitivity)
- Build-up
- Outburst, techniques to avoid outburst in public (breathing, etc...)
- Unwind, it is important to do this phase in order to avoid accumulation

Empathy -> listen to someone else's emotion
It is difficult as there could be a mismatch between verbal and non-verbal communication (93%)

Values as Freedom, Justice, Equality, Respect, Solidarity, Autonomy and Civilty always have
- Rights, what I expect from others
- Responsabilities, what I owe to others

8 emotional archetypes - G. Berger
- Relationship to action: active vs non-active
- Proximity with emotions: close vs weak

| Relationship to action | Proximity with emotions | Short-term reaction | Long-term reaction |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Active | Close | Irritable | Passionate |
| Active | Weak | Short-tempered | Phlegmatic |
| Non-active | Close | Sentimental | Anxious |
| Non-active | Weak | Amorphous | Apathetic |


Assertiveness (A. Salter) - stating your position in a simple, direct and non-aggressive way.

Analyse the conflict (observed consequences, causes of the conflict, value systems, risk factors)
Decide to act based on: awareness of the impasse, hope for a resolution, material or symbolic form of grief

Grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.

DESC discussion
1. **D**escription: facts!
2. **E**xplaining feelings
3. **S**olutions
- Time solution
- Actor solution (who does what)
- Rule solution
- Hardware solution
- Space solution
- Actual or symbolic reparation
4. **C**onclusion/Consequences

Studies show that conflicts are more often resolved to avoid negative consequences than in the hope of achieving some gain.
