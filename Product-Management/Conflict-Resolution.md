### Problems, disagreements, and conflicts

- A **problem** is different from a disagreement as it can be resolved.
- A **disagreement** is a form of creativity! Not negative in themselves.
- A **conflict** is a disagreement with visible tension that persists over time and worsens. 

There are three stages in the development of a conflict: **tension**, **crisis**, and **stagnation**.

- Tension allows for a win-win resolution. It might not be visible to all parties involved.
- Crisis resolution will be win-lose, as some sort of mediation is needed.
- Stagnation is lose-lose. Conflict is visible and might not be solved

### Causes of tension

**Objective causes**

- Technical (disagreement on tasks, process).
- Economic (lack of or insufficient means/resources).
- Power dynamics (competition, power games, will power of the strong, over-reaction of the weak).
- Rules (non-compliance or different interpretation of regulations, rules, contracts).
- Information (incomplete/false, not shared, unspoken, secrets).
- Witnesses and public opinion (acceleration or inhibition of conflict).
- Defective communication (impossibility of dialogue, negative communication, manipulation).

**Subjective causes**
- People and relationships (confrontation of identities, personalities, incivility, relationship to authority).
- Expression of emotions (fear, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, shame, jealousy, suffering).
- Beliefs, values, cultural practices.
- Internal conflict (individual dilemma, personal malaise turned outwards which affects others around the individual).
- Old conflict (simmering resentment).
- Misinterpretation of a situation (over-sensitivity to words, actions, bad faith).
- Confrontation between groups (individual and group loyalties).
